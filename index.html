      <h3>FM Saidov holds talks with AIIB President Jin Liqun</h3>
      <p>
        “Today at the headquarters of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
        in Beijing we had a productive meeting with the president of the bank
        Jin Liqun,” Saidov wrote in his Telegram channel. At the meeting, the
        parties discussed the current state of bilateral relations and prospects
        for their further development. “We appreciate the bank’s commitment to
        further supporting reforms taking place in Uzbekistan. We have every
        opportunity to increase the number of joint projects with the bank,” he
        said. It should be recalled that on May 19 this year, during a state
        visit to the PRC, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev received the President of
        the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Jin Liqun, in the city of
        Xi’an. The parties discussed the implementation of several joint
        projects.

        Based on the inflation rate in 2023, the cost of minimum consumer
        expenses for 2024 amounted to 621,000 soums per month, the Statistics
        Agency said. Compared to last year, the cost of MCS increased by 9.3%
        (53,000 soums). In 2023, minimum consumer spending was 568 thousand
        soums per person a month. The agency noted that in world practice the
        MCS is used as a poverty line in order to identify the target population
        group in need of material and other social assistance from the state.
        When identifying the poverty line in a country, the characteristics of
        real consumption and the needs of the population of the target group
        should be taken into account. The MSC is also used to increase the
        effectiveness and targeting of tasks and activities defined in the
        strategies and programs to combat poverty. In addition, the minimum
        consumer spending amount is necessary as a criterion for determining the
        minimum amount of pensions and benefits, as well as for providing other
        types of material assistance to low-income families.
